# Gatus Configuration for AdGuard Home HA Integration
# This configuration demonstrates endpoint monitoring that will be polled by AdGuard Home HA
# AdGuard Home HA will poll the Gatus API directly, no webhooks needed

# Endpoints to monitor
# IMPORTANT: Endpoint names must match "GatusEndpointNames" in AdGuard Home HA config
# AdGuard Home HA will poll these endpoints via Gatus API
endpoints:
  # Primary web service monitoring
  - name: "primary-web-check"  # Matches GatusEndpointNames in service config
    url: "http://192.168.1.100:8080/health"
    method: GET
    interval: 30s
    conditions:
      - "[STATUS] == 200"
      - "[RESPONSE_TIME] < 2000"
    # No alerts needed - AdGuard Home HA polls the status directly

  # Secondary web service for redundancy  
  - name: "secondary-web-check"
    url: "http://192.168.1.100:8080/health"  # Same service, different monitor
    method: GET
    interval: 30s
    conditions:
      - "[STATUS] == 200"
      - "[RESPONSE_TIME] < 2000"
    # No alerts needed - AdGuard Home HA polls the status directly

  # Backup service monitoring
  - name: "backup-web-check"
    url: "http://192.168.1.101:8080/health"
    method: GET
    interval: 30s
    conditions:
      - "[STATUS] == 200"
      - "[RESPONSE_TIME] < 2000"
    # No alerts needed - AdGuard Home HA polls the status directly

  # API service with JSON response validation
  - name: "api-service-check"
    url: "https://api.example.com/health"
    method: GET
    interval: 45s
    conditions:
      - "[STATUS] == 200"
      - "[RESPONSE_TIME] < 3000"
      - "[BODY].status == 'UP'"
    # No alerts needed - AdGuard Home HA polls the status directly

  # External website monitoring
  - name: "external-web-check"
    url: "https://www.example.com"
    method: GET
    interval: 60s
    conditions:
      - "[STATUS] == 200"
      - "[RESPONSE_TIME] < 5000"
      - "len([BODY]) > 1000"
    # No alerts needed - AdGuard Home HA polls the status directly

# Configuration Tips:
# 1. Use descriptive endpoint names that identify the monitoring source
# 2. Set intervals based on your SLA requirements (30s for critical services)
# 3. Adjust response time thresholds based on your infrastructure
# 4. Use multiple endpoints per service for redundancy
# 5. Match endpoint names exactly with AdGuard Home HA configuration
